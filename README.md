## About Our App
This web application aims to combat online cyberbullying and online harassment by analyzing the sentiment of inputed text and conversations in order to detect malicious messages. The categories include the following:
* Anger
* Sadness
* Disgust
* Fear
* Joy

We hope that this tool can currently be used to determine whether or not an incident of cyberbullying has occurred based upon the given conversation, and in the future hope to implement real-time feedback in messaging services to analyze sentiment prior to a message being sent. This way, we can begin to combat cyberbullying and online harassment before it begins.
